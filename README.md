# Hangman game
For my Milestone Project 3 on Code Institute's Diploma in Software Developement course I have created a hangman game.

For link to the app click [Here](https://python--hangman.herokuapp.com/) 

## Who is this website for?

This is a hangman game suitable for adults 18+.

## The owner

The owner of this game is Sabina Storm Bj√∂rlestrand

## What does it do?

The quiz has 20 words that are chosen at random. The player can guess att a letter or word. The player has six guesses until it's game over.

## User experience

### User stories

#### From customers perspective

- As a user I want to navigate clearly and logically through the game

- As a user I want to know what to do next in
- As a user I want to have options
- As a user I want to see my score
- As a user I want to know the correct answer
- As a user I want to be able to restart the game

#### Customers perspective fulfilment

- The first question is visible at start and also the option buttons
- The next and previuos buttons navigate
- The website has a section with the users score
- For correct answer the user receives one point
- The restart button restarts the game

- Game features

### Feature for future implementation
- Responsivenes for small mobile devices
- An information text about the correct answer to show after the user has answered to make the game more educational.
- A score traker so the user can compare their score with other users

## Technologies used

- [Python]()
- [Git](https://gitpod.io/) for version control
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) for keeping the files, documents and deployment of the website

## Resources

- [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/) course materials
- [Code Institute](https://learn.codeinstitute.net/) Slack Community
- [Stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
- [W3schools](https://www.w3schools.com/)
- [Am I Responsive](http://ami.responsivedesign.is/) for a responisve image in Read Me
- [5pence](https://5pence.net/) for markdown
- [Codingninjas](https://www.codingninjas.com/blog/2020/11/03/how-to-create-a-quiz-in-javascript/) for javascript and CSS code 

## Testing

### Browser testing

Website has been tested in Google chrome and Safari

Website has been testen on Apple Iphone

Both test confirmed that the website works great

All the functions and responsiveness do not work on Apple iPhone

### Validators

The website has been through W3C Jigsaw validation with no errors.

Website has been through W3C HTML Validator and there is no error to report

### Local testing

Testing of all the buttons shows no errors

### Responsiveness

I used Google Chrome Dev Tools to check the responsiveness of website. The website is not compatible with Apple iPhone for now.

## Version control

### Git and Github

I used GitPod as a local repository and GitHub as a remote repository. The process of version control was:

- First i created a new repository in GitHub
- Then opened that repository in GitPod and started coding
- In GitPod i created my files and folders
- I then saved my work and pushed it to GitHub repository to keep it safe

Saving, commiting and pushing it to remote repository in terminal:
- git add . 
- git commit -m "Commit message" 
- git push to update work to GitHub

## Deployment

To deploy the website, I followed the below steps on [Heroku](https://id.heroku.com/).

- Create a new app
- 
- 
- 
## Creating the Heroku app

When you create the app, you will need to add two buildpacks from the _Settings_ tab. The ordering is as follows:

1. `heroku/python`
2. `heroku/nodejs`

You must then create a _Config Var_ called `PORT`. Set this to `8000`

If you have credentials, such as in the Love Sandwiches project, you must create another _Config Var_ called `CREDS` and paste the JSON into the value field.

Connect your GitHub repository and deploy as normal.


Welcome Sabinastorm,

This is the Code Institute student template for deploying your third portfolio project, the Python command-line project.
